Data Pipeline | Airflow Dag for Tweet Extration | PySpark Transformation

This is an assigment from my Data Pipelines course on Alura Tech School. 

The airflow folder contains Python scripts that extract data from Twitter such as tweets, user, conversation_id, etc.

The spark folder contains the PySpark scripts that processes data and makes it fit for analysis.
